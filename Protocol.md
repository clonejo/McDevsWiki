This page presents a dissection of the current stable [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/game/) protocol. The current pre-release protocol is documented [elsewhere](Pre-release_protocol.md). The protocol for Pocket Minecraft is substantially different, and is documented at [Pocket Minecraft Protocol](Pocket_Minecraft_Protocol).

If you're having trouble, check out the [FAQ](Protocol_FAQ) or ask for help in the IRC channel ([#mcdevs on irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/mcdevs)).

Packets
========

All packets begin with a single "Packet ID" byte. Listed packet size includes this byte. Packets are either "server to client", "client to server", or "Two-Way" (both). Packets are not prefixed with their length. For variable length packets, you must parse it completely to determine its length.

Keep Alive (0x00)
-----------------
*Two-Way*

The server will frequently send out a keep-alive, each containing a random ID. The client must respond with the same packet. The Beta server will disconnect a client if it doesn't receive at least one packet before 1200 in-game ticks, and the Beta client will time out the connection under the same conditions. The client may send packets with Keep-alive ID=0.

Packet ID   | Field Name    | Field Type | Example   | Notes

Login Request (0x01)
--------------------
*Server to Client*

See [Protocol Encryption](Protocol_Encryption) for information on logging in.

Total Size: | 10 bytes + length of strings

Chat Message (0x03)
----------------
*Two-Way*

The default server will check the message to see if it begins with a '/'. If it doesn't, the username of the sender is prepended and sent to all other clients (including the original sender). If it does, the server assumes it to be a command and attempts to process it. A message longer than 100 characters will cause the server to kick the client. (As of 1.3.2, the vanilla client appears to limit the text a user can enter to 100 charaters.) This limits the chat message packet length to 203 bytes (as characters are encoded on 2 bytes). Note that this limit does not apply to chat messages sent by the server, which are limited to 32767 characters since 1.2.5. This change was initially done by allowing the client to not slice the message up to 119 (the previous limit), without changes to the server. For this reason, the vanilla server kept the code to cut messages at 119, but this isn't a protocol limitation and can be ignored. 

For more information, see [Chat](Chat).

0x03        | Message    | string     | <Bob> Hello World! | User input must be sanitized server-side
Total Size: | 10 bytes + length of strings


Time Update (0x04)
----------------
*Server to Client*

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000 ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long. 

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000 is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight. 

The default SMP server increments the time by 20 every second.

Total Size: | 7 bytes + slot data


Spawn Position (0x06)
----------------
*Server to Client*

Sent by the server after login to specify the coordinates of the spawn point (the point at which players spawn at, and which the compass points to). It can be sent at any time to update the point compasses point at. 

Packet ID   | Field Name | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x06        | X          | int        | 117     | Spawn X in block coordinates

            | Z          | int        | -46     | Spawn Z in block coordinates
Total Size: | 13 bytes


Use Entity (0x07)
----------------
*Client to Server*

This packet is sent from the client to the server when the client attacks or right-clicks another entity (a player, minecart, etc). 

A Notchian server only accepts this packet if the entity being attacked/used is visible without obstruction and within a 4-unit radius of the player's position. 


Packet ID   | Field Name   | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|--------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x07        | User         | int        | 1298    | The entity of the player (ignored by the server) 
            | Target       | int        | 1805    | The entity the player is interacting with 
            | Mouse button | boolean    | -true   | true when the player is left-clicking and false when right-clicking.
Total Size: | 10 bytes


Update Health (0x08)
----------------
*Server to Client*

Sent by the server to update/set the health of the player it is sent to. Added in protocol version 5. 

Food saturation acts as a food "overcharge". Food values will not decrease while the saturation is over zero. Players logging in automatically get a saturation of 5.0. Eating food increases the saturation as well as the food bar. 


Packet ID   | Field Name      | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|-----------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x08        | Health          | short      | 20      | 0 or less = dead, 20 = full HP
            | Food            | short      | 20      | 0 - 20
            | Food Saturation | float      | 5.0     | Seems to vary from 0.0 to 5.0 in integer increments
Total Size: | 9 bytes


Respawn (0x09)
----------------
*Server to Client*

To change the player's dimension (overworld/nether/end), send them a respawn packet with the appropriate dimension, followed by prechunks/chunks for the new dimension, and finally a position and look packet. You do not need to unload chunks, the client will do it automatically. 

Packet ID   | Field Name      | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|-----------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x09        | Dimension       | int        | 1       | -1: The Nether, 0: The Overworld, 1: The End
            | Difficulty      | byte       | 1       | 0 thru 3 for Peaceful, Easy, Normal, Hard. 1 is always sent c->s
            | Game mode       | byte       | 1       | 0: survival, 1: creative, 2: adventure. The hardcore flag is not included

            | Level type      | string     | default | See [0x01 login](Protocol#login-request-0x01)
Total Size: | 11 bytes + length of string 


Player (0x0A)
----------------
*Client to Server*

This packet is used to indicate whether the player is on ground (walking/swimming), or airborne (jumping/falling). 

When dropping from sufficient height, fall damage is applied when this state goes from False to True. The amount of damage applied is based on the point where it last changed from True to False. Note that there are several movement related packets containing this state. 

This packet was previously referred to as Flying 


Packet ID   | Field Name | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x0A        | On Ground  | boolean    | 1       | True if the client is on the ground, False otherwise 
Total Size: | 2 bytes


Player Position (0x0B)
----------------
*Client to Server*

Updates the players XYZ position on the server. If Stance - Y is less than 0.1 or greater than 1.65, the stance is illegal and the client will be kicked with the message “Illegal Stance”. If the distance between the last known position of the player on the server and the new position set by this packet is greater than 100 units will result in the client being kicked for "You moved too quickly :( (Hacking?)" Also if the absolute number of X or Z is set greater than 3.2E7D the client will be kicked for "Illegal position"

            | On Ground  | boolean    | 1       | Derived from packet [0x0A](Protocol#player-0x0A)
Total Size: | 34 bytes


Player Look (0x0C)
----------------
*Client to Server*

Updates the direction the player is looking in. 

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry rules. The unit circle of yaw on the xz-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns backwards towards (-1, 0), or in other words, it turns clockwise instead of counterclockwise. Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 360. 

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down. 

You can get a unit vector from a given yaw/pitch via: 

	x = -cos(pitch) * sin(yaw)
	y = -sin(pitch)
	z =  cos(pitch) * cos(yaw)

Player Position and Look (0x0D)
----------------
*Two Way*

A combination of [Player Look](Protocol#player-look-0x0C) and [Player Position](Protocol#player-position-0x0B). 

Note: When this packet is sent from the server, the 'Y' and 'Stance' fields are swapped. 


Packet ID   | Field Name | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x0D        | X          | double     | 102.809 | Absolute position

Total Size: | 42 bytes


Player Digging (0x0E)
----------------
*Client to Server*

Sent when the player mines a block. A Notchian server only accepts digging packets with coordinates within a 6-unit radius of the player's position. 


Packet ID   | Field Name | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x0E        | Status     | byte       | 1       | The action the player is taking against the block (see below)
0x0E        | X          | int        | 32      | Block position 
            | Y          | byte       | 64      | Block position
            | Z          | int        | 32      | Block position
            | Face       | byte       | 3       | The face being hit (see below)
Total Size: | 12 bytes

Status can (currently) be one of six values:

Meaning                     | Value
----------------------------|-------
Started digging             | 0
Cancelled digging           | 1
Finished digging            | 2
Drop item stack             | 3
Drop item                   | 4
Shoot arrow / finish eating | 5

Notchian clients send a 0 (started digging) when they start digging and a 2 (finished digging) once they think they are finished. If digging is aborted, the client simply send a 1 (Cancel digging). 

Status code 4 (drop item) is a special case. In-game, when you use the Drop Item command (keypress 'q'), a dig packet with a status of 4, and all other values set to 0, is sent from client to server. Status code 3 is similar, but drops the entire stack. 

Status code 5 (shoot arrow / finish eating) is also a special case. The x, y and z fields are all set to 0 like above, with the exception of the face field, which is set to 255. 

The face can be one of six values, representing the face being hit: 

Value  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
-------|----|----|----|----|----|-----
Offset | -Y | +Y | -Z | +Z | -X | +X

In 1.7.3, when a player opens a door with left click the server receives Packet 0xE+start digging and opens the door. 


Player Block Placement (0x0F)
----------------
*Client to Server*

Packet ID   | Field Name        | Field Type        | Example | Notes
------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|----------------------------
0x0F        | X                 | int               | 32      | Block position
            | Y                 | unsigned byte     | 64      | Block position
            | Z                 | int               | 32      | Block position
            | Direction         | byte              | 3       | The offset to use for block/item placement (see below) 
            | Held item         | [slot](Slot_Data) |         | 
            | Cursor position X | byte              | 0-16    | The position of the crosshair on the block 
            | Cursor position Y | byte              | 0-16    | 
            | Cursor position Z | byte              | 0-16    | 
Total Size: | 14 bytes + slot data

In normal operation (ie placing a block), this packet is sent once, with the values set normally. 

This packet has a special case where X, Y, Z, and Direction are all -1. (Note that Y is unsigned so set to 255.) This special packet indicates that the currently held item for the player should have its state updated such as eating food, shooting bows, using buckets, etc. 

In a Notchian Beta client, the block or item ID corresponds to whatever the client is currently holding, and the client sends one of these packets any time a right-click is issued on a surface, so no assumptions can be made about the safety of the ID. However, with the implementation of server-side inventory, a Notchian server seems to ignore the item ID, instead operating on server-side inventory information and holding selection. The client has been observed (1.2.5 and 1.3.2) to send both real item IDs and -1 in a single session. 

Special note on using buckets: When using buckets, the Notchian client might send two packets: first a normal and then a special case. The first normal packet is sent when you're looking at a block (e.g. the water you want to scoop up). This normal packet does not appear to do anything with a Notchian server. The second, special case packet appears to perform the action - based on current position/orientation and with a distance check - it appears that buckets can only be used within a radius of 6 units. 


Held Item Change (0x10)
----------------
*Two-Way*

Sent when the player changes the slot selection 


Packet ID   | Field Name | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x10        | Slot ID    | short      | 1       | The slot which the player has selected (0-8)
Total Size: | 3 bytes


Use Bed (0x11)
----------------
*Server to Client*

This packet tells that a player goes to bed. 

The client with the matching Entity ID will go into bed mode. 

This Packet is sent to all nearby players including the one sent to bed. 


Packet ID   | Field Name    | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|---------------|------------|---------|----------------------------

Total Size: | 15 bytes


Animation (0x12)
----------------
*Two-Way*

Sent whenever an entity should change animation. 


Packet ID   | Field Name    | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|---------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x12        | Entity ID     | int        | 55534   | Player ID
            | Animation     | byte       | 1       | Animation ID
Total Size: | 6 bytes

Animation can be one of the following values: 

ID  | Animation
----|------------
0   | No animation
1   | Swing arm
2   | Damage animation
3   | Leave bed
5   | Eat food
102 | (unknown)
104 | Crouch
105 | Uncrouch

Only 1 (swing arm) is sent by notchian clients. Crouching is sent via 0x13. Damage is server-side, and so is not sent by notchian clients. See also 0x26.


Entity Action (0x13) 
----------------
*Client to Server*

Sent at least when crouching, leaving a bed, or sprinting. To send action animation to client use 0x28. The client will send this with Action ID = 3 when "Leave Bed" is clicked. 


Packet ID   | Field Name    | Field Type | Example | Notes
------------|---------------|------------|---------|----------------------------
0x13        | Entity ID     | int        | 55534   | Player ID
            | Action ID     | byte       | 1       | The ID of the action, see below.
Total Size: | 6 bytes

Action ID can be one of the following values:  

ID  | Animation
----|------------
1   | Crouch
2   | Uncrouch
3   | Leave bed
4   | Start sprinting
5   | Stop sprinting


Spawn Named Entity (0x14)
----------------
*Server to Client*

The only named entities (at the moment) are players (either real or NPC/Bot). This packet is sent by the server when a player comes into visible range, not when a player joins. 

Servers can, however, safely spawn player entities for players not in visible range. The client appears to handle it correctly. 

At one point, the Notchian client was not okay with receiving player entity packets, including 0x14, that refer to its own username or EID; and would teleport to the absolute origin of the map and fall through the Void any time it received them. However, in more recent versions, it appears to handle them correctly, by spawning a new entity as directed (though future packets referring to the entity ID may be handled incorrectly).

Entity Velocity (0x1C) 
----------------
*Server to Client*

This packet is new to version 4 of the protocol, and is believed to be Entity Velocity/Motion. 

Velocity is believed to be in units of 1/8000 of a block per server tick (50ms); for example, -1343 would move (-1343 / 8000) = −0.167875 blocks per tick (or −3,3575 blocks per second). 

(This packet data values are not fully verified)

Entity Relative Move (0x1F)
----------------
*Server to Client*

This packet is sent by the server when an entity moves less then 4 blocks; if an entity moves more than 4 blocks [Entity Teleport](Protocol#entity-teleport-0x22) should be sent instead. 

This packet allows at most four blocks movement in any direction, because byte range is from -128 to 127. Movement is an offset of Absolute Int; to convert relative move to block coordinate offset, divide by 32.
